# freq-lang

This game was created to make easier the process of learning another language, by selecting the 1000 most used words, a multiple choice is given to the user so it can repeat the process as long as he wants.

The frontend was made using angular-2 and scala was used as backend(scalatra web-framework), angular consumes a REST api and scala provides data to the game.
